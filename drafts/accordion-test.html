      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion-dark">
        <div>
          <div>Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer for my company?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Great question! Hiring a full-time senior-level designer can cost over $75,000 annually, plus benefits—and that's if you can find one available. Additionally, client demand often fluctuates, which means you might not always have enough work to keep them fully occupied, leaving you paying for time that isn't utilized.</p>
            <p>With our monthly plan, you have the flexibility to pause and resume your subscription as needed, ensuring you only pay for design services when you have work ready to be completed.</p>

        <div>
          <div>Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Once subscribed, you're able to add as many design requests to your queue as you'd like, and they will be delivered one by one.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>How fast will I receive my designs?</div>
          <div>
            <p>On average, most requests are completed in just two days or less. However, more complex requests can take longer.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>What will I receive in 48 hours?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Within 48 hours, you'll receive the initial design draft for your review. This could be a complete design for simpler projects or a work-in-progress for more complex requests. We'll continue refining based on your feedback until you're completely satisfied.</p>

        <div>
          <div>How does the pause feature work?</div>
          <div>
            <p>We understand you may not have enough design work to fill up entire month. Perhaps you only have one or two design requests at the moment. That's where pausing your subscription comes in handy.</p>
            <p>Billing cycles are based on 31 day period. Let's say you sign up and use the service for 21 days, and then decide to pause your subscription. This means that the billing cycle will be paused and you'll have 10 days of service remaining to be used anytime in the future.</p>

        <div>
          <div>How do you handle larger requests?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Larger projects are broken down into smaller milestones. We'll work with you to prioritize and deliver in phases, ensuring consistent progress and allowing for feedback along the way.</p>

        <div>
          <div>What programs do you design in?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Most requests are designed using Figma. We also use Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) depending on the project requirements.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>How do I request designs?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Design Mind offers a ton of flexibility in how you request designs using Trello. Some common ways clients request designs is directly via Trello, sharing Google docs or wireframes, or even recording a brief Loom video (for those who prefer not to write their briefs out). Basically, if it can be linked to or shared in Trello, it's fair game.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <div>What if I don't like the design?</div>
          <div>
            <p>No worries! We'll continue to revise the design until you're 100% satisfied.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Is there any design work you don't cover?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Absolutely. Design Mind does not cover the following design work: 3D modeling, animated graphics (GIFS, etc.), document design (medical forms, etc.), complex packaging, and extensive print design (magazines, books, etc.).</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>What if I only have a single request?</div>
          <div>
            <p>That's fine. You can pause your subscription when finished and return when you have additional design needs. There's no need to let the remainder of your subscription go to waste.</p>

          <div>Are there any refunds if I don't like the service?</div>
          <div>
            <p>Due to the high quality nature of the work, there will be no refunds issued.</p>
